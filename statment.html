    <h1> Artist Statment</h1>

    <p> Rhyan Maldonado is a Gilroy based artist that photographs the up close view of sports. Aswell as examines the relationships between humans and the internet. Her work is to help others see what it is like in her eyes every time she steps on a field or a court. And to help bring awareness on how humans have obsessions to the internet world. </p>
  <p><em> 3 Seconds Left</em> is a project that Rhyan is working on to show the  emotional side of what it is like on the basketball court. The trials and tribulations of only having 3 seconds left in a game is shown in her work to help others get a closer look on the emotions that players have when they are trying to keep the lead with only 3 seconds left versus the emotions of trying to take the lead. This project will be created through photographs that will be taken at different high school basketball games to portray the highs and the lows.</p>
