      <h3><em>Trapped, Glitched 2019</em></h3>
      <p>This is a glitched digital image. I began with the original being a jpeg photo. I took this image my junior year of high school. It is of one of my classmates in my photography class. The original image is very crisp due to the camera settings since it was really sunny that day. I decided to intentionally remove data to explore the loss of it in an image. I did this through a glitching process in audacity that allowed me to remove data.

      <h3><em>Last Meal, Composite 2019</em></h3>
      <p>This is a composite image that uses a google image of an alter and found images. This new still life image explores the relationship that humans have to fast food and how fast food can be deadly which is a possibility that it will be your last meal. I composited images from one of the biggest fast food in the world which is Mcdonalds. I placed the food all over the altar and placed a skull at the top to show how this food can lead to death potentially.</p>

      <h3><em>This is Us, Netart 2019</em></h3>
        <p>This interactive net art piece is inspired by my data profile. I created a social media profile that has all the words people think of when they think of me. I asked my friends, family, and coworkers to say the first word that comes to mind, However, I added what I like to do and what I feel is me as the pictures to show the comparison.

       <h3><em>Santa! Code is Art 2019</em></h3>
       <p>This net art piece was created using the p5.js programming system. In this work I consider how a lot of people actually use the internet as well as isolate themselves from their families and society. However, once the holidays come in that seems to be the time where we disconnect from the internet and spend time more time with family and seem excited about that. I feel like I that is me sometimes and I have to learn to disconnect with the internet not just on holidays.

    <h3><em> Hollywood's Bleeding, Composite 2019</em></h3>
    <p>This piece is a composite I created with google images and found ones. This composite is to represent the corruptions that are happening in Hollywood. Such as all the scandals, drama, etc. The ufos, robots, fires all represent how Hollywood is name to big movies that include these but those robots and ufos represent the take over of Hollywood. However, there is a starring sky to depict that there are sides of Hollywood that arenâ€™t corrupt as some areas.
